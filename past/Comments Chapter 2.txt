Comments Chapter 2
In center of mass add that the sum of masses is non-zero

With this restriction in the proof add: if the sum is non-zero, then one can remove one of the masses so that the sum of the rest is non-zero

In axioms add invariance under multiplication of all masses by the same number

Add a multidimensional example of medians in tetrahedron

Add that this is linear algebra and can be done over any field
